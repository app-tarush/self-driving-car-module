*Few points under consideration*

(Please note docker environment is used in solving this project as mentioned under the CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit. The setups and container image is used as detailed in CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

1. Run function `find_lanes(img)` while accessing the project pipeline along with helper functions.
2. For task `Improve the draw_lines() function` do run following functions code block `hough_lines_2, draw_single_line, process_image_2`.
3. For `Optional Challenge task` do run code block for function `process_image_3(image)`.
